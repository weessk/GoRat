A Remote Administration Tool & Stealer developed in Go. It utilizes Discord for command and control (C2), offering a lightweight and efficient solution for remote system management and data gathering.

**Current Status: BETA.** The tool is functional but under active development. Features may be added or changed.

---
## Features
- **Remote Shell:** Full command-line access via `cmd` and `powershell`.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Includes methods for UAC bypass and elevation to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
- **Stealth Capabilities:** Implements PEB unlinking, API hooking, and process name spoofing to evade detection.
- **Discord C2:** All operations are managed through a discreet Discord server.
- **Persistence:** Employs techniques to ensure the agent survives system reboots.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Capable of extracting Discord tokens and sensitive browser data (credentials, cookies).
- **Live Surveillance:** Real-time desktop screenshot capture.
- **Self-Destruct:** A kill-switch command to remove all traces of the agent from the target system.
- **Compact Payload:** The compiled executable is under 3MB.

ðŸ“œ **Changelog:** [See latest updates](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Detection Status
This is a proof-of-concept and does not include advanced obfuscation or encryption beyond a modified UPX packer. The compiled binary is unobfuscated, meaning its functions and strings are easily identifiable with reverse engineering tools.

-   **Initial State:** The payload has a low detection rate against many standard antivirus solutions.
-   **Expected Lifespan:** As a public tool, it will likely be fingerprinted by security vendors and detection rates will increase significantly over time.

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
-   Go (Golang) compiler installed and configured.

### Building
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Execute the `build.bat` script.
3.  The script will prompt you to enter your Discord **Bot Token** and **Server ID**.
4.  Upon successful compilation, the output file `WinSecurityHealth.exe` will be created in the project directory.

## Commands
All commands are executed within the corresponding bot channel on your Discord server.

|                           | `!shell <command>` | Executes a command using PowerShell.                                     |
|                           | `!screen`          | Captures a screenshot of the primary display.                            |
|                           | `!exit`            | Removes the agent and deletes all traces from the system.                |
