# changelog - latest stuff n hacks

## v0.3.2 - third drop? idk lol ðŸ”¥

### added
- poc for chrome v127+ decryption (app_bound, super experimental lol)
- now scans all profs, not just "default"
- bookmarks parser, grabs all da bookmarks
- more chromium targets: beta/dev/canary + funky ones like vivaldi

### changed
- full module refactor, faster & cleaner, easier to add future parsers

### notes
- chrome v127+ decryption is mostly a test/poc, may break next builds
- honestly, no clue if this is really the 3rd drop lol, just rollin' with it
